# Dogcat CTF site exploit

Exploit made to dogcat Tryhackme CTF challenge.
Injects a php code in Apache2 logfile then make a request to include it in the home page , leveraging a LFI vulnerability.
A php reverse shell will be uploaded to the server and executed to provide a shell to the user.

I made this code as a study resource to better understand some python modules and cybersecurty concepts.

Also, try beating the challenge on your own before using this code :)
